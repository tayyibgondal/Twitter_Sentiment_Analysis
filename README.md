Sentiment analysis is the automatic process of classifying text data according to their polarity, such as positive, negative and neutral. Companies leverage sentiment analysis of tweets to get a sense of how customers are talking about their products and services, get insights to drive business decisions, and identify product issues and potential PR crises early on.

In this repository, I shared a step-by-step process to do sentiment analysis.

First, I used Tweepy, an open source Python library to get tweets mentioning @NotionHQ using the Twitter API. Then I used the Inference API for doing sentiment analysis. Once I got the sentiment analysis results, I created a chart to visualize the results and detect some interesting insights.
